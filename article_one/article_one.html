			<p>You need a little burst of spring time baseball talk? New Canaries manager Mike Meyer is your guy for that.</p>
			<p>There are coaches and managers in sports who will go into a season trying to temper expectations so as to not give followers of a team an unrealistic view of the world. Then there are the guys who are so pumped up they can’t get the words out fast enough.</p>
			<p>“The big thing with Mike, along with his experience in independent ball, is his passion for the sport and the city itself,” said Canaries general manager Duell Higbe. “He likes it and his family likes it. He’s lived and breathed this town and he’s got the passion to sell it to players against some of the bigger markets like Winnipeg, St. Paul and Kansas City.”</p>
			<p>Meyer, a former Canary pitching coach who will be getting his first opportunity to run the show, is candid about the franchise’s six consecutive last-place finishes, but at the same time has both guns drawn as far as 2017 is concerned.</p>

			<p>“It’s a dream come true,” said Meyer, 39, an Arizona native who pitched in the St. Louis Cardinals’ organization and also for the St. Paul Saints. “I spent eight great years as a pitching coach in Sioux Falls with Steve Shirley and two great years working with Pete Incaviglia in Laredo, but I’ve always wanted to have my own team and shape it and run it the way I wish my managers ran our teams. We’re going to be doing something great.”</p>
			<p>The Canaries will tell you the ill-fated 2016 season had two distinct parts to it and that Meyer, along with former Canary Ben Moore as pitching coach and former Canary Eddie Gerald working with the hitters, will change that with the help of a more talented lineup.</p>
			<p>In Part I, the team got off to a fast start the first week and then collapsed, culminating in manager Chris Paterson losing his job on July 19 while the club was mired in a nine-game losing streak with 38 losses in its previous 50 games.</p>
			<p>Sioux Falls brought in interim manager Shelby Ford for the remainder of the season and Canaries improved, going 23-22 over the last 45 games to finish 40-60. They had to win six of their last seven to reach that mark.</p>
